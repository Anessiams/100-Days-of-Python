Some new things to remember: 

When getting input, you can format the input before it stores into the variable
    variable = int(input("How old are you?"))

when performing mathematical equations its important to ensure the vairable is converted to a datatype that operations can be performed
    int(variable)
    float(variable)

exponents: (variable ** 2)

When doing a print statment the variable has to be the correct type when using this format:
    print("My age is" + age + "years old")
Using this format it doesnt matter:
    print(f"My age is {age} years old")
